I coded the most popular sorting algorithms as a Python learning exercise.

Classification:

    stability
    time complexity
        best possible time complexity: nLog2n (Heap, merge)
    Common Algorithms:

    Selection Sort
    Bubble Sort
    Recursive Bubble Sort
    Insertion Sort
    Merge Sort
    Quick Sort
    Iterative Quick Sort
    Heap Sort
    Counting Sort
